Do I even do science?

Petting our cat

Our cat, Brooklyn, is fuzzy and very cute.

The beauty of the alpine
--------
There are many things I love about the mountains - the striking beauty of snow on rock, the sense of self-sufficiency afforded by a large backpack, the pine-scented air above a tumbling stream, the delicate balance between fire, forest, and fuzzy critter. I know I'm biased, because I grew up spending a lot of time in these landscapes and they represent both home, a sense of adventure, and where I fell in love. But one of the more fleeting joys of the mountains is the small, chirping "eep" that reverberates through a canyon or a scree field as an American Pika shouts a warning to its friends.

As you can see, they're cute little things. They'd almost certainly fit in the palm of your hand, and they live almost exclusively above treeline in talus slopes and cliffs in the Rocky Mountains and farther west. For me, they embody the alpine. Pikas spend the summer gathering plant matter and building a surprisingly large pile in their burrows - you'll most often see them scampering with a wide load of green flopping from their mouths. This pile is their food source for the winter, because while they inhabit sufficiently inhospitable terrain that few humans spend more than daylight hours there in the summer, they don't even hibernate and spend the winter scampering around under the snow (though mostly in their burrows). 

This somewhat intense lifestyle requires a lot of insulation, and while they lose some of their winter coat in the summer, they can still die from heat exhaustion at temperatures as low as 78°F (25.5°C). As the climate warms, they face a serious threat of extinction. Already living near the top of high, mountainous regions, they can't move much higher to escape the heat. And given their small size and inability to tolerate high temperatures, a northward migration seems unlikely. They have already disappeared from more than a third of their prior habitats in Nevada and Oregon. Alpine zones are heating faster than low-lying areas, and the [National Wildlife Federation](https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/American-Pika) now believes they could be among the first species to go extinct as a direct result of climate change. 

There are of course so many other reasons to fight climate change, but I hope that this one little creature can help move us toward action.

I got really into making some bourgeois pizza.
