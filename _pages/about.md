Hi! If you'd like my CV you can download it [here](/files/Ryter_CV.pdf). Please check out ways to reach me as well as my various other homes on the web in the menu (either to the left or above, depending on your screen resolution) and click the links at the top of the page to check out some of my other experience and work!

## What do/did I do?
While I work in the general field of materials science and have done a good amount of experimental work in this field, I currently do computational work analyzing material supply chains, their environmental impacts, and how we can reduce them in Elsa Olivetti's [research group](http://olivetti.mit.edu). We analyze the economic relationships between mines, refineries, and recyclers to understand how national policies (such as [China's solid waste import ban](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23874-7)), global supply chain disruptions (such as [COVID-19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23874-7) - yes it's the same link lol), and changes in recycling policy (paper coming soon) influence each of these actors. We typically treat recycled materials as providing environmental benefits, but their main benefits come from eliminating the energy-and emission-intensive mining and refining required by virgin materials. Our work shows that it takes time for these benefits to occur, requiring price changes and mine repsonse to create real impacts, and that these benefits are unlikely to exceed ~60% of what we would expect.  

I received by bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana in 2017. Through on-campus experimental research and internships at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), I have worked to develop a variety of renewable energy technologies including solid oxide fuel cells, hydrogen vehicles, and perovskite solar cells. I grew up in Hamilton, Montana.

## What do I care about?
Climate change, sustainability, and equity. We already have the technologies we need to re-engineer our energy systems, and we can make it much easier on ourselves by reducing our total energy needs and transitioning away from our current unsustainable systems. The extraction of materials creates economic benefits alongside massive ecological and human damage, and we have many opportunities to reduce these damages and empower local communities. Mining companies' net worths frequently exceed the GDP of the countries they operate in, creating massive power imbalances. These issues are compounded by accelerating demand for renewable energy materials, while climate change exacerbates water, infrastructure, and societal risks in these areas. Ore grades continue to decline, making extraction more expensive and energy-intensive, and we continue to export our extraction to countries and states without the politcal and economic power to enforce best practices. 

About this site
===============

This website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) as recommended by [Rachel Kurchin](https://rkurchin.github.io/) and hosted on GitHub Pages. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
