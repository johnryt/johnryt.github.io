The IPCC has said carbon capture and storage (CCS) is all but necessary for us to stay below even 2Â°C of global warming. But to any sort of sizeable dent in our emissions, this finicky, 40-year-old technology would need to be implemented and advanced so fast as to be unimaginable, particularly when other, more sustainable solutions are far more readily available. Is it a ploy by the fossil fuel industry, or a realistic, thermodynamically-favorable solution?
