title: "Emission impacts of China's solid waste import ban and COVID-19 in the copper supply chain"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-06-18-china
excerpt: "We developed a regionalized version of the copper model and attempted to understand how China's pollution-control strategies affect the copper supply chain and global environmental impacts. We found that, for the most part, pollution was outsourced to nearby countries in Southeast Asia, but that China could mitigate the global $CO_2$ emissions impacts by decreasing imports of copper concentrate (the product of mining). Shortly after we published an earlier version of this work on archiv (but before this work was officially published), China did exactly that."

We developed a regionalized version of the copper model and attempted to understand how China\'s pollution-control strategies affect the copper supply chain and global environmental impacts. We found that, for the most part, pollution was outsourced to nearby countries in Southeast Asia, but that China could mitigate the global $CO_2$ emissions impacts by decreasing imports of copper concentrate (the product of mining). Shortly after we published an earlier version of this work on archiv (but before this work was officially published), China did exactly that. I don't think they necessarily did so because of this work, but it's cool to see science and policy align.
