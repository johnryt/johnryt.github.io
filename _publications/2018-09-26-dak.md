excerpt: "[Dr. Dak Benjia Dou](http://dak.mit.edu/) did some amazing work developing perovskite solar cell functional layers compatible with large-scale thin film manufacturing methods. I played an impressively small role, showing that the typical solution used to deposit the tin oxide electron transport layer was incompatible with the substrates and deposition methods we were trying to use, causing significant variability in cell performance."

[Dak](http://dak.mit.edu/) did some amazing work developing perovskite solar cell functional layers compatible with large-scale thin film manufacturing methods. I played an impressively small role, showing that the typical solution used to deposit the tin oxide electron transport layer was incompatible with the substrates and deposition methods we were trying to use, causing significant variability in cell performance.
