excerpt: "This was the first publication on which I was included, since I helped [Lik Ming Aw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lik-ming-aw-5612a883/) with some of the experiments and sample preparation for the development of thin-film protective coatings for high-temperature gas turbine components. It was my first introduction to the clean room and I had a lot of fun with this work."

This was the first publication on which I was included, since I helped [Lik Ming Aw](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lik-ming-aw-5612a883/) with some of the experiments and sample preparation for the development of thin-film protective coatings for high-temperature gas turbine components. It was my first introduction to the clean room and I had a lot of fun with this work.
