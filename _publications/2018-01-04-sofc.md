excerpt: "This was my first first-author publication, the culmination of the work I did as an undergraduate at Montana State University with Dr. Roberta Amendola, [Dr. Madisen (Sickler) McCleary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madisen-mccleary-1b6b5470/), and our collaborators at the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research in Taiwan and the University of Genoa in Italy. I know Roberta and Madisen did a lot of work on this paper after I graduated, and I am very much in their debt. Roberta Amendola played an absolutely pivotal role in developing my career and I cannot thank her enough."

This was my first first-author publication, the culmination of the work I did as an undergraduate at Montana State University with Dr. Roberta Amendola, [Dr. Madisen (Sickler) McCleary](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madisen-mccleary-1b6b5470/), and our collaborators at the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research in Taiwan and the University of Genoa in Italy. I know Roberta and Madisen did a lot of work on this paper after I graduated, and I am very much in their debt. Roberta Amendola played an absolutely pivotal role in developing my career and I cannot thank her enough.
