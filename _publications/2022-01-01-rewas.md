excerpt: "Conference paper for The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS - the T stands for 'three') 2022 conference in Anaheim, California. The paper and accompanying presentation are part of the REWAS (REcycling and WASte) symposium. Here we focus on smaller scrap supply shocks, on the order of what a country, state, city, or company could implement. We show that the efficiency of a given scrap supply increase in producing environmental benefits remains subject to economic effects, though less so than larger shocks due to the decrease in the rebound effect. We also show that demand-side recycling policies (such as recycled content mandates) must be coupled with a corresponding increase in scrap supply or their benefits will not be realized."

Conference paper for The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS - the T stands for 'three') 2022 conference in Anaheim, California. The paper and accompanying presentation are part of the REWAS (REcycling and WASte) symposium. Here we focus on smaller scrap supply shocks, on the order of what a country, state, city, or company could implement. We show that the efficiency of a given scrap supply increase in producing environmental benefits remains subject to economic effects, though less so than larger shocks due to the decrease in the rebound effect. We also show that demand-side recycling policies (such as recycled content mandates) must be coupled with a corresponding increase in scrap supply or their benefits will not be realized.
